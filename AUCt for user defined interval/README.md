# Calculate the Area under the curve for user defined time intervals

A graph of the predicted vs observed AUC and Cmax ratios data is generated in this example script.

## This script shows

1.  How to run the Simcyp™ Simulator from R i.e. Setting up a Simcyp™ R script.

2.  How to extract the systemic concentration time profile with and without interaction for the full population.

3.  How to calculate the AUCt for a user defined time interval.

4.  How to calculate the summary statistics of AUCt and Cmax Ratio for each trial.

## How to run this example

After downloading all the files, open `AUCt for user defined interval.R` file and run the script. An E-Learning video on how to run this script can be found on Simcyp members area.
