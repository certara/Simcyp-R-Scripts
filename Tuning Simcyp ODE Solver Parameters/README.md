# Tuning Simcyp ODE Solver Parameters with Simcyp-R

## This script shows

1.  How to change Simcypâ„¢ solver setting parameters from R.

2.  How to run a simulation and save the output to database file.

3.  How to query the database and extract:

    -   The simulation duration.

    -   The number of simulated individuals with negative concentrations.

## How to run this example

After downloading all the files, open `Tuning Simcyp ODE Solver Parameters.R` file and run the script. A detailed video on how to run this script can be found on Simcyp members area.
