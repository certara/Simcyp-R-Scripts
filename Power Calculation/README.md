# Power calculation-DDI study

The workspace used looks at the interaction between Lorezapam and Probenecid. In this example, we determine the sample size that is required for correctly detecting the difference between 2 population group when there is a true difference. For this we use AUC as the measurement parameter. 

## This script shows

1.  How to run a Simcyp™ simulation and store the results to a database file.

2.  How to extract the AUC (with and without interaction) simulated for the full population groups.

3.  Power analysis for various sample sizes.

## How to run this example

After downloading all the files, open `Power calculation-DDI_V24.R` file and run the script. A detailed video Simcyp™ power calculation tool can be found on [YouTube]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALCtd9Mw5Ew).
