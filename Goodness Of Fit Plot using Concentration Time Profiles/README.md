# Goodness Of Fit Plot using Concentration Time Profiles

A graph of the predicted vs observed concentration time (CT) profile data is generated in this example script.  


## This script shows

1.  How to run the Simcyp™ Simulator from R i.e. Setting up a Simcyp™ R script.

2.  How to run a Simcyp™ simulation and extract the predicted concentration time profile in R.

3.  How to plot a graph of the predicted vs observed concentration time profile along with the line of identity, 1.25 fold and 2 fold deviation area.

## How to run this example

After downloading all the files, open `Goodness Of Fit Plot- CT Profiles.R` file and run the script.
