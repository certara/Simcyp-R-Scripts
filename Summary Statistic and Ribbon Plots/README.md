# Summary Statistic and Ribbon Plots

In this example script, we show you how to extract the summary statistics and make a summary plot of systemic concentration profiles generated for a population, using the Simcypâ„¢ R package. 

## This script shows

1.  How to run a simulation and store the results to an output database file.

2.  How to extract the systemic concentration-Time data for the full population from the generated database file.

3.  How to make a plot of the individual profiles.

4.  How to extract the Mean, Lower and Upper percentile values of the simulated systemic concentration profile for the population.

5.  How to extract the trial Mean, Lower and Upper percentile values of the simulated systemic concentration profile for each trial.

6.  How to create a Ribbon Plot of the simulated systemic concentration profile with and without interaction. 


## How to run this example

After downloading all the files, open `Summary Statistic and Ribbon Plots with Simcyp-R Package.R` file and run the script. A detailed video on how to run this script can be found via Simcyp members are or on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn5YVLGPis4).
