# Goodness Of Fit Plot using AUC and Cmax Ratio Data

A graph of the predicted vs observed AUC and Cmax ratios data is generated in this example script.

## This script shows

1.  How to run the Simcyp™ Simulator from R i.e. Setting up a Simcyp™ R script.

2.  How to run a Simcyp™ simulation and extract the summary statistics of the predicted AUC and Cmax ratio of in R.

3.  How to plot a graph of the predicted vs observed PK ratio along with the line of identity, 1.25 fold deviation area, 2 fold deviation area and guest criteria area.

## How to run this example

After downloading all the files, open `Goodness Of Fit Plot- PK Ratio Data.R` file and run the script.
