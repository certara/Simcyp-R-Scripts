# Forest plot example
The workspaces used to run this example script verifies Simcyp<sup>TM</sup> V23 Atazanavir compound file. Where the summary statistics of the predicted AUC and Cmax ratio are calculated for each DDI study using Simcyp<sup>TM</sup> R Package and presented as a forest plot.
 
## This script shows
* How to run the Simcyp<sup>TM</sup> Simulator from R i.e. Setting up a Simcyp<sup>TM</sup> R script
* How to extract the necessary data for forest plots; here for each DDI workspace, we run a simulation and extract the population statistics of the predicted AUC and Cmax ratios     
* How to use those data to make a forest plot of the predicted and observed geometric mean AUC and Cmax ratios   
 
## How to run this example
After downloading all the files, open `Simcyp R package - Forest plot example.R` file and run the script. A detailed video on how to run this script can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=gzMcdbEolDqc7hpl&v=bi6M6IpCYdc&feature=youtu.be).
