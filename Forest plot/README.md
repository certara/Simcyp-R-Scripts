# Forest plot example 

The workspaces used to run this example script verifies Simcyp™  V23 Atazanavir compound file. Where the summary statistics of the predicted AUC and Cmax ratio are calculated for each DDI study using Simcyp™  R Package and presented as a forest plot. 

## This script shows

1.  How to run the Simcyp™ Simulator from R i.e. Setting up a Simcyp™ R script

2.  How to extract the necessary data for forest plots; here for each DDI workspace, we run a simulation and extract the population statistics of the predicted AUC and Cmax ratios

3.  How to use those data to make a forest plot of the predicted and observed geometric mean AUC and Cmax ratios   

## How to run this example

After downloading all the files, open `Simcyp R package - Forest plot example.R` file and run the script. A detailed video on how to run this script can be found on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/bi6M6IpCYdc?si=gzMcdbEolDqc7hpl).
