# Multi-Species Simulation

In this example we show you how to call in and run a simulation on various Simcyp™ workspaces of different animal species. We use the Simcyp™ Monkey and Dog species for demonstration. However, this code can be adapted to call in any of the Simcyp™ Animal (Monkey, Dog, Mouse, Rat) or Human simulator.

## This script shows

1.  How to set up the Simcyp-R script and make connection to Simcyp™ Monkey and Dog simulator, respectively.

2.  How to run a simulation and save the results to a database for each species.

3.  How to extract the Systemic concentration time profile for each species.

## How to run this example

After downloading all the files, open `Multi-Species Simulation.R` file and run the script.
